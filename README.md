# Responsive Challenge: Dawg Coffee

This folder contains your submission for the [responsive challenge](http://faculty.washington.edu/mikefree/info343/#/challenges/responsive). The below questions should be answered with details about your submission!

##### 1. What is the URL of this site, as hosted on your student webserver (i.e., students.washington.edu/<code>{uw-new-id}</code>/info343/<code>{project-name}</code>) #####
> http://students.washington.edu/jnbobo/info343/dawg-coffee/dawg-coffee/

##### 2. Did you receive any help from others (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who. #####
> nope

##### 3. Did you complete any advanced extensions to this challenge? If so, what? #####
> nope

##### 4. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge? #####
> too many. If I had to guess I'd say over 20hrs. Mostly because I'm pretty new to html and css, but as I went farther into the assignment, troubleshooting and progression in general got easier.

##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better? #####
> yeah, a ton. I guess the biggest single thing that could help future students would be a lecture on css etiquette. Most of my problems were due to my lack of experience in css, and the convoluted code that I wrote as a result, I think a lecture or cheat sheet walking students through a sample website's css page would help. Examples showing inheritance, cascading, when/how to use class vs id vs element as a whole, and using classes to be more specific (ie <element>.<class> or #<id> <element> vs using element class or id to affect several things at once. Things went noticably better for me after I started to grasp those concepts.
